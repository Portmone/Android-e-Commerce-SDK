# Changelog v 3.0.11 date 2025-10-03


### Fixed

- fixed in Mass payments
- Removed: card.io library — incompatible with systems using 16 KB memory page sizes.
The Google Pay Card Recognition API, which is part of Google Play Services, is now used. This requires additional SDK configuration by the user.
Without the required configuration, card recognition will not be available, and users will be limited to manual card entry only.

### Changed

- The card.io library is not used, delete from build.gradle
